# Daily Work Report - January 21, 2026

Today we worked on fixing critical issues with the Awaz Pulse radio streaming platform. We started by fixing an Icecast stream type switching error where the validation decorators were incorrect in the backend. Then we installed and configured the Icecast server on the Mac using Homebrew, updated the configuration file with proper passwords, and got it running on port 8000. We helped configure the Butt broadcasting software to connect to Icecast with the correct settings including changing the mountpoint from a UUID to simply "stream". After that, we fixed the stream URL in the database and modified the backend to prioritize Icecast streams over HLS for lower latency. We then fixed the user dashboard to properly fetch and play Icecast streams instead of trying to use HLS. The main issue we solved was the real-time metadata updates - the show title and host name were not updating on the user dashboard without a page refresh. We fixed this by importing NgZone and ChangeDetectorRef into the user dashboard component and wrapping the metadata subscription callback in ngZone.run() to trigger Angular's change detection. We also added comprehensive logging throughout the metadata update process to help with debugging. Now when the station owner selects a show in the control panel, the metadata updates instantly on the user dashboard showing the correct show title, host name, and show type without any page refresh. We created documentation including an Icecast setup guide, a technical fix explanation, and a testing guide. All features are now working correctly with low-latency streaming and real-time metadata updates.
